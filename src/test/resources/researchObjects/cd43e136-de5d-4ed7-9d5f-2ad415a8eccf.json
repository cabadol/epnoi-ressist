The derivative spectrophotometric method was based on the determination of both the drugs at their respective zero crossing point (ZCP). The first order derivative spectra was obtained in methanol and the determinations were made at 225.20 nm (ZCP of IAtorvastatin) for Irbesartan  and 308.15 nm (ZCP of Irbesartan) for Atorvastatin. The linearity was obtained in the concentration range of succinate 5-30 μg/ml for Irbesartan and 5- 30 μg/ml for Atorvastatin Succinate. The mean recovery was 99.25 and 99.65% for Irbesartan and Atorvastatin succinate, respectively. The method was found to be simple, sensitive, accurate and precise and was applicable for the simultaneous determination of Irbesartan and Atorvastatin in synthetic mixture. The results of analysis have been validated statistically and by recovery studies.The proposed method is recommended for routine analysis since they are rapid,simple, accurate and also sensitive and specific by no heating and no organic solvent extraction.Keywords: Irbesartan, atorvastatin, simultaneous estimation,First order derivative,
