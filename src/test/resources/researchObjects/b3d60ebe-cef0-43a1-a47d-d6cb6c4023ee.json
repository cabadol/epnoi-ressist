Materials and Methods: The mice were divided into 5 groups for each testing methods, each group consist of five animals. Group 1 served as a control and was given normal saline 0.9% (5ml/kg,IP), group 2 received (20 mg /Kg, IP) fluoxetine as a standard control. Group 3, 4, 5 were treated with three different doses of diphenhydramine (0.5, 1, 2 mg /Kg, IP) respectively. The normal behaviors of each group of mice were evaluated after 30 min. of drug administration. The test was used to evaluate the antidepressant activity of diphenhydramine in Open Field, Modified Forced Swimming Test and Tail Suspension Test. Results: It is found that the increase in the locomotor activity in open field cage by increasing the number of square cross to (94.2±28.7) (93.2±25.6) (86.6±22.1) respectively according to the doses of diphenhydramine in comparison with control group (69.4±27.2) at p\u0026lt; 0.05. In modified forced swimming test, the result also showed that the administration of diphenhydramine at (0.5, 1, 2 mg /Kg, IP) were reduced the immobility time (68.8 ± 21.1) (56.4 ± 17.7) (47.6 ± 21.7) Sec. respectively in comparison with control group. In the present study, It is found that the administration of diphenhydramine at (0.5, 1, 2 mg /Kg,IP) were significantly increased in the swimming time (143.2 ± 16.2) (152.6 ± 18.7) (160.02 ± 15.5) Sec. Sec. in comparison with control group (28.8 ± 3.4) Sec. Conclusion: Thus, this study suggested that the administration of diphenhydramine is produced a good therapy used in the treatment of depressed patients without side effect . Key words:
