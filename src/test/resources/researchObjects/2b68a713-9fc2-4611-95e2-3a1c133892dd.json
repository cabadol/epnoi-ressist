Problem based learning was explained to them by power point presentation by the first author before the questionnaires were distributed. Then the students were asked to fill the questionnaires which were collected within ten minutes. Results: Thirty two students answered that PBL has ‘generated interest’ in them as student while one student answered ‘definitely yes’.Students were asked ‘do they think it is a better way of teaching/learning’? Twenty nine students answered yes, three answered definitely yes and one answered may be.Students gave variety of replies to the question ‘ why they thought it was better’? Majority of students wrote that active participation brings responsibility, enhances learning and retention. PBL will be a realistic way of teaching. Students also felt that PBL is active form of learning and it is deep learning, it will boost student confidence and strengthens students’ teacher relationship. They also felt that it will be interesting and practical.Conclusions: The questionnaire survey among the final year MBBS professional students revealed their interest in PBL. The reason we would prefer PBL to be introduced in the IMS, BHU is because it is a self-learning method which is the deepest form of learning. It is well known that we will need more resources and also more staffing to continue doing PBL but it will be worth the effort for our students.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Pandey-U.","name":"U.","surname":"Pandey"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Mahapatra-T.%20M.","name":"T.
