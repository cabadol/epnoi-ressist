The title of the RTE Act incorporates the words ‘free and compulsory’. ‘Free education’ means that no child, other than a child who has been admitted by his or her parents to a school which is not supported by the appropriate Government, shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education. ‘Compulsory education’ casts an obligation on the appropriate Government and local authorities to provide and ensure admission, attendance and completion of elementary education by all children in the 6-14 age group. With this, India has moved forward to a rights based framework that casts a legal obligation on the Central and State Governments to implement this fundamental child right as enshrined in the Article 21A of the Constitution, in accordance with the provisions of the RTE Act.\nKey WordsBEEOs- Block Elementary Education Officers, BRCs- Block Resource Coordinators, CABE- Central Advisory Board of Education, EE- Elementary Education,RTE- Right to Education, SMC-School Management Committee","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Pandey-Anamika","name":"Anamika","surname":"Pandey"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Shrivastava-Rachana","name":"Rachana","surname":"Shrivastava"}]},"bagOfWords":["right","school","govern","children","state","implement","teacher","compulsori","india","appropri","elementari","provis","child","which","complet","group","central","fundament","constitut","respons","articl","april","parent","local","provid","ensur","effect","admit","author","admiss","legal","statu","univers","weaker","section","class","anamika","receiv","other","support","shall","liabl","expens","prevent","pursu","oblig","attend","block","manag","committe","among","centr","legisl","specif","standard","clear","requir","histori","suprem","court","after","amend","parliament","draft","rajyasabha","august","except","speech","prime","minist","commit","categori","academ","elect","facil","through","monitor","least","report","between","would","cover","review","anamikapandei","rachana","shrivastava","mittal","institut","bhopal","email","gmail","revis","accept","abstract","incorpor","charg","forward","framework","enshrin","accord","keyword","offic","resourc","coordin","advisori","board","introduct","defin","process","develop","human","whose","affect","realizationof","indian","concurr","clamor","financi","capac","deliv","collect","revenu","subsidi","mahatma","gandhi","sixti","independ","fifti","eight","instead","direct","principl","fifteen","insert","restrict","prepar","three","facilit","realiz","rough","compos","introduc","decemb","approv","cabinet","loksabha","presidenti","assent","notifi","whole","jammu","kashmir","first","brought","manmohan","singh","irrespect","gender","social","access","enabl","acquir","skill","knowledg","attitud","necessari","becom","activ","citizen","object","satisfactori","qualiti","advantag","therefor","nearli","depend","compuls","enrol","dropout","expel","corpor","punish","mental","harass","qualif","appoint","authoris","prohibit","deploy","purpos","decenni","censu","disast","relief","legislatur","specifi","infrastructur","relat","pandei","innovar","journal","pupil","ratio","commun","particip","compris","member","women","proportion","represent","depriv","collabor","special","unaid","belong","disadvantag","neighborhood","capit","screen","without","recognit","million","remain","shortag","shadow","forum","repres","network","countri","howev","challeng","point","sever","behind","schedul","interven","demand","northeast","pariti","haryana","assign","continu","conclus","import","achiev","ampli","ground","order","priorit","invest","realiti","dialogu","consult","stakehold","within","outsid","anoth","never","distanc","conceptu","current","incompat","decid","whether","reformul","bring","differ","mechan","refer","retriev","septemb","rteimplement","iharnew","index","educatio","ssachhattishgarh"]}
