Pots were prepared with different compositions of Red soil, Vermicompost, NPK and Azolla cultures. Healthy seeds of BPT rice variety were collected from Raj Agro Form, Dindigul and showed in pots with thirteen treatments and watered regularly. The various growth parameters such as percentage of Seed germination, Shoot length, Root length, No of leaflets, No of root branches, Wet and Dry weight of whole plants of different treatment were observed periodically for 21 days. The total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were estimated in all treatments including control. The rapid growth rate of rice plant was recorded between 15Â  to 21days of pot cultures due to the influence of Azolla biofertilizers. This study will attract the farmers to use Azolla biofertilizers for rice cultivation","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/NN-Arumugam","name":"Arumugam","surname":"NN"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/DEPT%20OF%20BIOLOGY-GANDHIGRAM%20RURAL%20UNIVERSITY%0AGANDHIGRAM-%20DINDIGUL%0ATAMIL%20NADU%0AINDIA","name":"GANDHIGRAM RURAL UNIVERSITY\nGANDHIGRAM- DINDIGUL\nTAMIL NADU\nINDIA","surname":"DEPT OF BIOLOGY"}]},"bagOfWords":["azolla","paddi","microphylla","filiculoid","hybrid","treatment","chlorophyl","vermicompost","growth","speci","length","water","cultur","control","germin","studi","variou","weight","observ","content","nitrogen","condit","signific","shoot","biofertil","whole","analysi","differ","paramet","fresh","number","level","mahalingam","prepar","branch","carotenoid","product","treat","percentag","leaflet","total","estim","increas","under","recommend","standard","statist","cultiv","method","result","innovar","journal","which","enhanc","dindigul","multipli","varieti","period","influenc","fixat","field","associ","aquat","yield","popul","develop","compar","carri","calcul","grown","present","cultivar","vermin","compost","triplic","error","sativa","potenti","healthi","between","multipl","suppli","amount","fertil","procur","follow","measur","express","select","organ","produc","author","kannaiyan","effect","oryza","biologi","gandhigram","rural","univers","perform","collect","thirteen","regularli","rapid","factor","freshwat","through","anabaena","lemna","avail","countri","india","tropic","dairi","combin","sourc","evalu","materi","temperatur","direct","count","spread","formula","weigh","order","analyz","three","nutrient","seedl","cours","biomass","impact","harvest","respons","state","contribut","manuscript","sheet","colleg","scienc","stress","knowledgebank","vigor","soybean","review","origin","articl","muniappan","arumugam","senthil","murugan","depart","institut","district","tamil","email","munistudi","gmail","receiv","revis","accept","august","abstract","composit","includ","record","attract","farmer","keyword","introduct","quick","decompos","capac","becom","import","green","manur","atmospher","symbiot","insid","dorsal","substanti","sensit","ecosystem","stagnant","ditch","canal","season","cover","other","minor","applic","improv","achiev","strictli","system","wildli","scale","feasibl","where","labor","cheaper","effluent","medium","report","industri","exploit","bioferitil","preliminari","cement","slurri","super","phosphat","liter","inocul","optimum","maintain","coimbator","taken","clean","petripl","white","light","individu","averag","centimet","simultan","point","below","surfac","carefulli","uproot","balanc","gradual","everi","accur","arnon","homogen","aceton","centrifug","supernat","determin","spectrophotometr","prism","softwar","deviat","percent","variat","varianc","anova","check","discuss","float","found","environ","temper","region","world","among","fastest","earth","cyanobacteria","independ","extern","known","carbon","mainli","limit","phosphor","famili","salviniacea","strain","without","contamin","remov","oxygen","embryon","contain","within","format","approxim","drastic","graphic","comparison","given","photosynthesi","carbohydr","reserv","presenc","higher","enorm","major","absorpt","miner","indirectli","indic","oriza","treatmentson","carotinoid","extrem","strongli","conclus","preliminarili","fundament","investig","start","complet","degrad","logarithm","further","supplement","longer","function","interact","network","squar","grain","uptak","excret","reproduct","sporul","inoculum","along","shelf","extens","research","quintal","econom","statu","acknowledg","grate","provid","design","experiment","setup","implement","interpret","approv","refer","meghraj","venkateshwarlu","manag","press","coloradosundaravarathan","agronom","agricultur","indian","thangam","media","bionano","fronit","kulasooriya","constraint","william","zimmerman","pigment","blundon","david","ecolog","laboratori","manual","camosun","victoria","canada","train","categori","wahab","index","assoc","postharvest","copper","enzym","chloroplast","polyphenol","oxidas","vulri","physiol","gregori","wagner","botan","technolog","transfer","gangawan","publish","compani","delhi","mandal","benefici","exclud","wetland","biolog","teramura","perri","lydon","mcintosh","summer","radiat","photosynthet","recoveri","physiolog"]}
