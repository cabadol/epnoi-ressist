This type of study provides the health service at affordable cost. Since, the plant possess many medicinal properties, the present study was designed to evaluate the phytochemicals in the extract of Mikania cordifolia leaves. The leaves were collected and extracted with ethanol. Phytochemical screening was carried out consciously according to standard procedures. Tannins, flavonoids, saponins and gums were found to be present in the extract. Various biological effects of this plant may be attributed to the phytoconstituents present in the extract. The results obtained from this study suggest that the extract of Mikania cordifolia plant possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-nociceptive properties. Keywords: Mikania cordifolia, asteraceae, phytochemicals, tannins and flavonoids. ","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Kar-Auditi","name":"Auditi","surname":"Kar"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Mohammad-Nor","name":"Nor","surname":"Mohammad"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Majumder-Mohammad%20Sakim","name":"Mohammad Sakim","surname":"Majumder"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Al-Qayum-Rashed-","name":"Rashed-","surname":"Al-Qayum"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Didar%20Khan-Mohammad","name":"Mohammad","surname":"Didar Khan"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Bhattacharjee-Shovon","name":"Shovon","surname":"Bhattacharjee"}]},"bagOfWords":["extract","cordifolia","plant","medicin","studi","present","phytochem","mikania","screen","mohammad","chemistri","scienc","univers","bangladesh","octob","possess","properti","result","tannin","flavonoid","research","articl","hytochem","determin","charactarist","sakim","didar","shovon","auditi","feculti","chittagong","pharmaci","appli","chemic","engin","noakhali","technolog","sonapur","email","auditikar","gmail","receiv","revis","accept","abstract","object","tradit","involv","differ","provid","health","servic","afford","design","evalu","method","collect","ethanol","carri","conscious","accord","standard","procedur","saponin","found","variou","biolog","effect","attribut","phytoconstitu","conclus","obtain","suggest","antioxid","antimicrobi","analges","keyword","asteracea"]}
