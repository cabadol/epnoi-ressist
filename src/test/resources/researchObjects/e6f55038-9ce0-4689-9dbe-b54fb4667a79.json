The condition may be manifested as dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis and other types of fluorosis (non-skeletal fluorosis). Most importance is given to dental fluorosis by the researchers. But, skeletal fluorosis is another form of fluorosis which is often neglected; though this form of fluorosis can cause criplling of a person.
