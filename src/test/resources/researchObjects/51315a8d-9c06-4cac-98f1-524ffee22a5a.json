Chitosan stabilized oflaxacin-gold nanoparticles conjugate was prepared with aqueous solution of ofloxacin ,gold nanoparticles suspension  and chitosan under optimum condition. Synthesized nanoconjugate was .characterized by  scanning electron microscopy, FTIR and the synthesized nanoconjugate was tested against E.coli and Staph.aureus adopting well diffusion assay. Result. Synthesis of chitosan stabilized ofloxacin- gold nanoconjugate was primarly confirmed by colour change of the reaction mixture, characteristic change in the FTIR pattern and  size and shape by SEM. Anti bacterial activity revealed increased spectrum of antibacterial activity was recorded in chitosan stabilized ofloxacin - gold nanoconjugate against both the tested strains.  The highest increase in inhibitory zone for E.coli and Staph.aureus was observed. Conclusion. The present study suggests possible utilization of antibiotics –gold nanoconjugate as an effective anti microbial agent against the pathogenic bacteria Key words. chitosan,ofloxacin,nanoconjugate
