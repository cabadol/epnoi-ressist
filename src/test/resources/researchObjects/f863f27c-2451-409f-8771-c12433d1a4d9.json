However, there are several extra linguistic forms of communication that have been made possible also by sound and acoustic effects as in language production. Based on the foregoing, the paper investigates non verbal forms of communication among the Igbo people of the south eastern Nigeria. The production of sounds and acoustic effects from various traditional instruments are studied. Also, also various parts of the body other than the normal vocal sounds are investigated. Furthermore, the paper studied the use of these sounds in communication, especially in cultural communication among the Igbo people. We adopt the descriptive survey method and use the theoretical framework of oramedia an aspect ethno-cultural communication in exploring the dynamics of extra-linguistic sounds in Igbo cultural communication. The paper discovers that sound patterns and acoustic effects (extra linguistic) other than the sounds from the vocal tract system of man play a significant role in human communication, especially in cultural communication.\nKey words: sound, acoustic effects, extra-linguistic communication, non verbal communication, cultural
