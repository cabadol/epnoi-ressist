The results revealed that irrigation at 0.8 IW:CPE being at par with 1.0 IW:CPE enhanced growth and yield attributes and thereby green cob and fodder yield along with higher net returns and B:C ratio over irrigation at 0.6 IW:CPE. Application of 120-60 kg N-P2O5/ha being at par with 150-75 kg N-P2O5/ha improved growth and yield attributes and ultimately higher green cob and fodder yields with higher net returns and B:C ratio over control and 90-45 kg N-P2O5/ha. Therefore, irrigation at 0.8 IW:CPE and fertilizer dose of 120-60 kg N-P2O5/ha could be applied for higher yield and economical realization from rabi sweet corn along with appreciable saving of water and fertilizer under climate change conditions.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Mathukia-R.%20K.","name":"R.
