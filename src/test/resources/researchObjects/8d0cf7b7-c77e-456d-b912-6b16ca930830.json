High plasma levels of insulin and glucose due to insulin resistance often lead tometabolic syndrome. Chronic inflammation associated with metabolic and immune system involves a network of cellular andsystemic responses that integrates many complex signaling pathways infiltration of inflammation cells in adipose tissue , abnormal pro-inflammatory cytokinesproduction(IL-8,TNF-α). The study is designed to measure glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c),IL-8 and TNF-α.These parameters and measures applied for thirty newly diagnosed  patients with diabetes before and after treatment divided into 3 group.Three groups of (10) patients each newly diagnosed withT2DM;group(1) receives:500mg metformin for 3 months with (HbA1c\u003d9.54±1.95,IL-8\u003d13.85±6.15,TNF-α\u003d260.1±123.7).                                                      group(2)receives:1000mg metformin for 3 months with (HbA1c\u003d9.16±1.55,IL-8\u003d15.02±6.28,TNF-α\u003d230.86±49.26).    group(3)receives:1500mg metformin for 3 months with(HbA1c\u003d9.80±1.94,IL-8\u003d14.41±4.61,TNF-\u003d207.42±40.45).                       Blood samples were withdrawn from the patients at pretreatment,then after 3 months of treatment. After 3 months of  treatment, patient who received metformin 1500mg had greater reduction in  HbA1c,IL-8 and TNF-α(27,9percent,44.20percent and49.75percent respectively),compared with patient who received metformin 1000mg(18.3percent,15.77percent,34.42percent respectively)and to metformin 500mg(10.3percent.12.56percent and 4.72percent).Metformin monotherapy are effective as an initial treatment of newly diagnosed diabetic patients in The national  diabetes center / University of Al-Mustansiriyah, Iraq.Metformin has significant reduction effect on these three group, had significant reduction in HbA1c and also significant reduction in cytokines in the three dose in different percent.Keywords,metformin,cytokines,diabetes","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/M.K-Yasser","name":"Yasser","surname":"M.K"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/M.%20R-Abbas","name":"Abbas","surname":"M.
