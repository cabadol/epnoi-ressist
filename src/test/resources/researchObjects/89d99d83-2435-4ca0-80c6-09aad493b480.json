Â The study concluded that the demand of pearl millet for food will increase over time. In 2025, total demand of pearl millet (food) will be 2613 thousand tonnes. In 2015, it is likely to be 136 thousand tonnes in urban and 1926 thousand tonnes for rural Rajasthan. In 2020, it will be 154 thousand tonnes for urban and 2165 thousand tonnes for rural Rajasthan. In 2025, it will be 174 thousand tonnes for urban and 2439 thousand tonnes for rural Rajasthan. Demand projection for pearl millet (grain) for alternative uses indicated that demand for cattle feed (concentrates) is projected to be 2018 thousand tonnes (2020) and 2340 thousand tonnes in 2025. The demand for poultry feed industry is projected at 1406 thousand tonnes in 2025. The demand for alcohol industry is projected to be 815 thousand tonnes (2020) and 1091 thousand tonnes in 2025. The demand for seed is pegged at 24 thousand tonnes and 25 thousand tonnes in 2020 and 2025 respectively. The supply of pearl millet (grain) is projected at 5401 thousand tonnes (2015), 6469 thousand tonnes (2020) and 7759 thousand tonnes (2025). The gap between demand and supply (grain) is projected to be a surplus of 51 thousand tonnes (2015), 192 thousand tonnes (2020) and 284 thousand tonnes (2025).","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Sharma-Shirish","name":"Shirish","surname":"Sharma"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Singh-I.P.","name":"I.P.","surname":"Singh"}]},"bagOfWords":["millet","pearl","demand","project","thousand","rajasthan","fodder","rural","suppli","urban","consumpt","total","grain","popul","product","annum","expenditur","regress","agricultur","capita","cattl","livestock","elast","concentr","coeffici","million","poultri","signific","distilleri","model","increas","altern","growth","given","reveal","buffalo","estim","respect","india","consum","research","variou","function","young","econom","present","industri","surplu","which","bajra","differ","round","quadrat","period","kumar","adult","requir","expect","assum","deficit","studi","percent","where","level","incom","linear","journal","assumpt","censu","green","review","pattern","alcohol","region","sourc","nutrit","effect","other","effort","starch","futur","follow","month","sharma","innovar","dikshit","birthal","stock","annual","compound","therefor","colleg","skrau","between","peopl","indian","hectar","around","farmer","speci","cereal","secur","sever","chapati","reason","season","state","especi","recip","enhanc","chang","scenario","order","polici","develop","invers","commod","found","human","potenti","nation","sampl","survei","report","sheep","constitut","under","compar","through","content","should","household","pakistan","articl","shirish","bikan","major","advisor","depart","shirishswm","gmail","receiv","revis","accept","abstract","conduct","conclud","indic","keyword","introduct","countri","billion","occup","character","small","averag","smaller","cultiv","nearli","arabl","group","grown","world","import","tropic","dietari","energi","highli","africa","amount","howev","factor","phytat","polyphenol","decreas","bioavail","indigen","knowledg","northern","mostli","winter","rabri","drink","haryana","popular","summer","local","known","laddoo","sweet","sugar","jaggeri","besan","prepar","chappati","khichdi","surviv","drought","threaten","cheaper","about","domest","economi","price","formul","crucial","situat","attempt","analyz","analyt","doubl","logarithm","constant","random","error","becaus","multipl","determin","highest","obtain","formula","result","discuss","accord","overal","further","certain","remain","would","categori","essenti","slightli","lower","hardli","multipli","current","interact","factori","taken","togeth","fifteen","actual","sustain","moder","implic","purpos","broken","jowar","breeder","initi","evolv","hybrid","varieti","thick","ensur","regular","susten","includ","intak","graze","yield","particular","refer","farooq","trevor","muhammad","iqbal","investig","punjab","museb","andhra","pradesh","market","paroda","south","agril","praduman","madan","ferdinand","paragua","three","stage","budget","framework"]}
