The results revealed that irrigation-fertigation through sub-surface drip system was proved to be superior in respect of pod yield, weed biomass, WUE and economics. Among weed management practices, two hand weedings at 30 and 60 DAS was found to be the most effective in controlling weeds along with higher pod yield, WUE and net returns.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Mathukia-R.%20K.","name":"R.
