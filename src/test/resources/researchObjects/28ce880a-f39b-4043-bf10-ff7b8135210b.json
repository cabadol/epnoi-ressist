Both the drugs show linearity in a concentration range of 05-30 μg/ml at theirrespective λmax and at the isoabsorptive point. Accuracy, precision and recovery studies were done by QC samplescovering lower, medium and high concentrations of the linearity range. The relative standard deviation for accuracy,precision studies were found to be within the acceptance range (\u0026lt;2%). The limit of determination was 0.365μg/ml and 0.0622μg/ml for Irbesartan and atorvastatin, respectively. The limit of quantification was 1.108μg/ml and 0.188μg/ml for Irbesartan and atorvastatin, respectively. Recovery of Irbesartan and atorvastatin were found to be 100.51% and 100.16% respectively confirming the accuracy of the proposed method. The proposed method is recommended for routine analysis since they are rapid,simple, accurate and also sensitive and specific by no heating and no organic solvent extraction.Keywords: Irbesartan, atorvastatin, simultaneous estimation, Q absorption ratio method, Q value analysis method","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Virani-Paras","name":"Paras","surname":"Virani"}]},"bagOfWords":["irbesartan","method","atorvastatin","solut","absorpt","respect","methanol","precis","develop","concentr","absorb","stock","estim","ratio","mixtur","recoveri","accuraci","found","review","formul","spectroscop","measur","valid","andatr","volumetr","prepar","calibr","differ","amount","synthet","parasvirani","point","wavelength","linear","analysi","solubl","scienc","flask","graph","ofirb","simultan","cardiac","accur","standard","determin","rapid","treatment","hypertens","select","result","patient","combin","analyt","innovar","journal","pharmaceut","transfer","dissolv","dilut","strength","paramet","calcul","equat","total","robust","drugbank","virani","condit","studi","limit","angiotensin","receptor","hyperlipidaemia","cholesterol","level","contain","weigh","three","ofatr","databas","avail","internet","pharm","sojitra","gujarat","surat","accept","simpl","propos","specif","solvent","antagonist","deriv","inhibit","diseas","heart","diabet","phenyl","white","given","insolubl","water","hepat","reductas","respons","decreas","consid","factor","complianc","therefor","quantit","orderspectraofirb","obtain","sampl","spectra","quantiti","correl","observ","averag","forirb","intradai","analyz","wasfoundto","forirband","rsdvaluewasfoundtobelessthan","interdai","mland","dataof","rugged","prove","instrument","stoke","assai","biolog","matrix","inventi","qualiti","assur","research","articl","rajanit","bhadresh","vineet","technologicalunivers","shreedhanvantarypharmacycolleg","email","gmail","receiv","novemb","revis","decemb","abstract","selectedfor","theirrespect","isoabsorpt","samplescov","lower","medium","deviat","within","quantif","confirm","recommend","routin","sensit","organ","extract","keyword","introduct","mainli","activ","nonpeptid","tetrazol","failur","myocardi","infarct","nephropathi","iupan","methyl","structur","almost","crystallin","powder","practic","sparingli","slightli","methylen","chlorid","agent","competit","enzym","convert","mevalon","biosynthesi","pathwai","subsequ","blood","structureofatorvastatin","iswhiteoralmostwhit","crystallinepowd","solubilityisgiveninpract","slightlysolublein","methylenechlorid","frequent","coexist","major","ultim","advers","event","cluster","potenti","common","mechan","further","manag","gener","better","would","advantag","singl","therapi","which","treat","atorvastati","literatur","regard","atorvastatinrev","attempt","spectrometr","chromatograph","report","theestim","individu","present","stabl","econom","atorvastatinin","overlainzero","linearityzero","orderspectra","materi","methodolog","doubl","visibl","spectrophotomet","shimadzu","model","japan","spectral","width","quartz","automat","system","softwar","balanc","sartoriu","gottingen","germani","sonic","class","glasswar","borosillict","solutionofirbesartan","pipett","volum","adjust","plott","versu","accord","overlai","distinct","overlain","order","reveal","possess","discuss","andrang","shown","figur","correlationcoeffici","forcalibrationcurveofirbandatrwasfound","theregress","follow","where","andatrat","valuewasfoundtobelessthan","check","addit","spike","recoveryforirbandatrbythismethodwasfoundintherang","thevalueof","rsdwithinthelimitindicatedthatthemethodisaccuratea","percentagerecoveryshow","therei","interferencefrom","excepi","detect","thelodforirbandatrwasconformedtob","theloqforirbandatrwasconformedtob","theobtainedlodandloqresult","arepresentedin","andloq","andrugged","theobtain","androbust","arepres","foundto","signific","chang","spectrum","ruggedand","robustnessandrugged","applic","ofthepropos","analysisof","irband","atrin","azeroorderspectrum","solutionwasrecordedand","forestimationofatr","andirb","determinedus","assayvaluesar","givenin","analysisdata","summari","ofvalid","regress","coeffici","conclus","employ","guidelin","indic","reliabl","refer","sabir","parmind","pharmacolog","profil","pharmacophor","wikipedia","dileep","santhi","sajeeth","administr","ezetimib","hypercholesterolemia","chemica","administ","antonio","roberta","roberto","effect","postprandi","endotheli","dysfunct","stress","inflamm","american","associ","updat","pharmatutor"]}
