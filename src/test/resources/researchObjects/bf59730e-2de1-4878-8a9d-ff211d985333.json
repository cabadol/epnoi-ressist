In respect of market capitalization, India ranks fourth in the world. But even after globalization, condition of agriculture has not improved. The share of agriculture in the GDP is only 17percent. The number of landless families has increased and farmers are still committing suicide. But seeing the positive effects of globalization, it can be said that very soon India will overcome these hurdles too and march strongly on its path of development. The lesson of recent experience is that a country must carefully choose a combination of policies that best enables it to take the opportunity - while avoiding the pitfalls. For over a century the United States has been the largest economy in the world but major developments have taken place in the world Economy since then, leading to the shift of focus from the US and the rich countries of Europe to the two Asian giants- India and China. Economics experts and various studies conducted across the globe envisage India and China to rule the world in the 21st century. India, which is now the fourth largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, may overtake Japan and become third major economic power within 10 years. To conclude we can say that the modernization that we see around us in our daily life is a contribution of Globalization. Globalization has both positive and as well as negative impacts on various sectors of Indian Economy. So Globalization has taken us a long way from 1991 which has resultant in the advancement our country.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Kumar-N.Prasanna","name":"N.Prasanna","surname":"Kumar"}]},"bagOfWords":["global","india","sector","economi","develop","countri","econom","polici","agricultur","industri","indian","foreign","world","growth","which","financi","invest","liber","market","trade","billion","govern","servic","privat","intern","capit","reform","about","impact","increas","import","popul","number","product","technolog","other","measur","export","poverti","china","integr","nation","chang","minist","globalis","rural","major","taken","becom","direct","social","public","domest","compani","million","power","employ","peopl","period","inflow","incom","share","farmer","effect","state","variou","result","includ","financ","allow","further","provid","total","should","mumbai","respect","after","condit","posit","recent","largest","place","advanc","through","crisi","reserv","singh","between","approach","annual","inform","present","order","under","addit","those","report","human","kumar","famili","asian","around","process","gener","currenc","health","known","given","price","institut","level","journal","especi","manufactur","labor","account","averag","against","depend","person","strategi","without","crore","survei","fourth","still","suicid","shift","across","globe","japan","within","contribut","introduct","cultur","commun","initi","follow","devalu","problem","scheme","investor","fiscal","resourc","competit","adopt","innovar","manag","reduc","subsidi","standard","earli","mainli","toward","innov","dynam","challeng","prospect","greater","exchang","regim","implement","manmohan","eleventh","billionair","studi","receiv","decemb","model","landless","opportun","europ","transport","refer","spread","relat","locat","local","overal","brought","facil","avail","where","enter","cannot","extent","structur","barrier","start","pharmaceut","chemic","corpor","progress","field","benefit","requir","remov","programm","credit","context","insur","threat","destin","almost","accord","estim","decad","chapter","restrict","despit","potenti","prosper","though","definit","knowledg","activ","encourag","program","tariff","percent","along","complet","licens","system","worst","budget","consult","expect","cumul","wherea","proport","appear","better","distribut","unemploi","particular","children","promot","delhi","lectur","assist","univers","highli","improv","commit","overcom","march","choos","combin","enabl","while","centuri","purchas","pariti","third","conclud","modern","describ","region","sometim","migrat","sphere","happen","shape","mohan","advent","suffer","balanc","payment","smooth","introduc","monetari","budgetari","extern","extend","consequ","implic","interdepend","movement","entir","rather","ignor","impli","depriv","equiti","essenti","control","expans","petroleum","cement","dismantl","unemploy","constitut","compon","tradit","emerg","transit","usher","unpreced","marin","mostli","nearli","revers","outsourc","diseas","smaller","indirectli","starvat","remark","backward","herself","imper","rapid","success","profit","precis","worth","contain","abroad","quantit","confid","close","western","south","undertak","approv","depart","automat","limit","subject","divest","electron","strengthen","three","prior","reduct","strong","epoch","everyth","befor","reach","memorandum","paragraph","forth","achiev","object","appropri","prime","gross","cross","septemb","attract","equip","suppli","indebted","deceler","releas","reason","continu","perform","directli","seriou","repli","short","sharad","pawar","sabha","eight","irrig","nobel","stiglitz","agreement","depress","point","demot","infrastructur","urban","dweller","everi","consumer","group","figur","domin","qualiti","school","class","digit","mortal","lanka","vietnam","centr","coloni","river","polit","victim","produc","higher","welfar","commerci","trend","depth","immedi","water","compet","sustain","research","articl","prasanna","professor","acharya","nagarjuna","email","yahoo","revis","accept","abstract","hurdl","strongli","lesson","experi","carefulli","avoid","pitfal","expert","conduct","envisag","overtak","daili","keyword","societi","network","specif","spatial","defin","intensif","worldwid","distant","event","occur","versa","dramat","herald","launch","disinvest","privatesector","asinsur","defenseindustri","salient","featur","redirect","scarc","unlik","friendli","intensifi","reflect","regard","determin","influenc","clear","formul","evalu","afford","possibl","action","reaction","constrain","option","autonomi","analysi","mainstai","privileg","revolv","correspond","exist","pattern","sever","grant","adjust","certain","attach","sought","gradual","phase","organ","allevi","assur","secur","buoyant","substanti","steel","textil","retail","andbpo","decreas","competitor","surviv","intermediari","readi","assum","regulatori","transform","conserv","offer","throughout","compris","estat","bounc","momentum","maintain","becaus","player","scene","singl","contributor","fifth","cereal","basmati","coffe","promin","
