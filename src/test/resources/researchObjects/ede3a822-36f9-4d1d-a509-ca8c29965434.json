Among the three solvents propanol shows the better results for extraction of resin and it was further confirmed with FTIR, TGA and DSC. The FT-IR (Fourier Trsnsform Infra Red Spectroscopic analysis was used to structural changes during the extracted resin using propanol. The maximum peak obtained using propanol as a solvent for the extraction of resin was 14-16 min intensity. All the experimental study throughout the present study indicated that the obtained resin has wide application on waste water treatment. In future, it can be used as a cheap substitute instead of commercial resin for a better environment.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Priya-Gomathi","name":"Gomathi","surname":"Priya"}]},"bagOfWords":["resin","extract","cashew","solvent","sampl","temperatur","sludg","propanol","analysi","process","shell","presenc","liquid","obtain","materi","remov","residu","differ","methanol","result","confirm","compound","light","starch","thermal","journal","research","present","diethyl","ether","water","industri","product","hydrocarbon","which","defat","group","stretch","chemic","studi","applic","solid","cultiv","produc","character","through","control","infrar","observ","thermo","gravimetr","priya","technolog","better","indic","largest","agricultur","carbon","provid","develop","india","taken","varnish","plant","properti","contain","avail","phenol","separ","polymer","degrad","design","effect","characterist","aromat","final","nitrogen","about","spectra","found","function","cation","differenti","scienc","articl","three","further","fourier","maximum","treatment","composit","other","sourc","nutrient","condit","varieti","improv","under","kerala","tamil","paint","surfac","agent","quantiti","fluid","compon","repres","readili","alkenyl","mixtur","cardanol","column","chromatographi","recov","exchang","where","contact","stream","vessel","minim","propan","second","nuclear","rajesh","ground","carri","anoth","blend","screen","filter","experi","perform","innovar","model","interfac","analyst","atmospher","pretreat","techniqu","interferomet","conclud","absorpt","identifi","alken","program","prepar","instrument","dynam","react","littl","calorimetr","chemistri","supercrit","radiat","anacardium","occidental","gomathi","sivamani","depart","engin","colleg","univers","email","pgpriya","annauniv","receiv","decemb","revis","accept","januari","abstract","among","trsnsform","infra","spectroscop","structur","chang","intens","experiment","throughout","futur","cheap","substitut","instead","commerci","environ","keyword","introduct","amount","gener","everi","altern","elimin","howev","usual","sugar","miner","protein","therefor","should","consid","moistur","suitabl","microorgan","great","possibl","ferment","support","worldwid","global","indian","council","director","effort","state","andhra","pradesh","maharashtra","orissa","bengal","district","cuddalor","kanchipuram","thanjavur","pudukottai","thiruchrap","chengalpattu","villupuram","ariyalur","automobil","brake","manufactur","epoxi","solubl","activ","synthet","rubber","foundri","specif","secret","particularli","conifer","associ","adhes","glaze","viscou","compos","mainli","volatil","terpen","lesser","dissolv","thick","sticki","bioresourc","natur","consist","cardol","methylcardol","synthesi","resourc","clear","brownish","color","exhibit","report","deliquefi","intermedi","refineri","proprietari","featur","ensur","effici","entrain","simpl","provis","handl","upset","unusu","sequenc","depend","recycl","consider","requir","typic","first","emploi","heavier","third","polish","attempt","morpholog","method","panrutti","muthandikuppam","store","follow","soxhlet","extractor","grade","ratio","ethanol","restrain","paper","freez","drier","prior","purif","least","duplic","perkin","elmer","whilst","spectrum","bomen","spectromet","access","while","alkali","solut","period","conic","flask","muslin","cloth","neutral","night","discuss","transform","spectroscopi","measur","allow","record","mirror","insid","apparatu","alter","distribut","compar","relev","alkyn","hydroxyl","ester","correspond","alkan","excel","somewhat","heavi","organ","substanc","monitor","specimen","subject","percent","weight","evalu","analyz","platinum","inert","decomposit","thermogravimetr","figur","befor","evapor","after","chain","break","rapidli","stabil","calorimet","place","start","assum","initi","onset","tonset","exotherm","tstop","determin","conclus","categori","refer","muruthi","sivasaman","recent","trend","proceed","intern","symposium","cochin","ranjana","yadav","deepak","srivastava","epoxid","novalac","patel","santanu","bandyopadhyai","anuradda","ganesh","econom","apprais","refin","chromatogr","yamamoto","sugai","onogaki","rheolog","classifi","potato","japanes","societi","green","mechan","metal","cyanid","anion","polym","vincz","solymosi","frani","scintil","physic","akinhanmi","atasi","akintokun","physicochem","environment","smith","malaluan","setianto","inomata","seper","dioxid","bioresour","technol","maria","yulian","huynh","truong","renew","desalin","oghom","kehind","african"]}
