Physical mixtures and wet granulated samples at different levels of processing were screened as in-process materials for compatibility and method suitability using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) techniques. Assessment of potential risks inherent in formulation and process unit operations was adequately addressed by these instruments.Results: Matching spectra, thermograms and chromatograms at different levels of processing indicated that there were no disappearance of old or appearance of new spectral bands; showed reduction of melting endotherm and similar characteristic elution times of AL as they transformed from pure material to physical mixture (PM) and to granules.Conclusion: Results from this work alluded to compatibility of formulation components and process method suitability to the extent that the resultant granulates were good enough for further processing.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Mustapha-Musibau%20Aderibigbe","name":"Musibau Aderibigbe","surname":"Mustapha"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Department%20of%20Pharmaceutics%20and%20Pharmaceutical%20Technology.%20Faculty%20of%20Pharmacy.%20University%20of%20Benin.%20Benin%20City%20300%20001-Edo%20state.%20Nigeria.","name":"Edo state.
