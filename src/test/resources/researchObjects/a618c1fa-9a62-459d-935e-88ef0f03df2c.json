Targeting delivery of drugs to the diseased lesions is one of the most important aspects of drug delivery system. They have been used in vivo to protect the drug entity in the systemic circulation, restrict access of the drug to the chosen sites and to deliver the drug at a controlled and sustained rate to the site of action. Various polymers have been used in the formulation of nanoparticles for drug delivery research to increase therapeutic benefit, while minimizing side effects. In order to see functionality and toxicity of nanoparticles invarious food and drug applications, it is important to establish procedures to prepare nanoparticles of a controlled size. NaturalControlled release of drugs from nanostructured functional materials, especially nanoparticles (NPs), is attracting increasing attention because of the opportunities in cancer therapy and the treatment of other ailments. The potential of magnetic NPs stems from the intrinsic properties of their magnetic cores combined with their drug loading capability and the biochemical properties that can be best owed on them by means of a suitable coating. ThisÂ  review was mainly focused on different techniques for the preparation of magnetic nanoparticles and their application in various field. In addition to that some of the applications in the field of biomedicine were also explained.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Sailaja-Abbaraju%20Krishna","name":"Abbaraju
