The optical spectra are consistent with direct optical transitions corresponding to the stoichiometric semiconductor Cu3N plus a free-carrier contribution, essentially independent of temperature, which can be tuned in accordance with the N-excess. Deviation of the N content from stoichiometry drives to significant decreases from − 5 to − 50 μV/K in the Seebeck coefficient and to large enhancements, from 10− 3 up to 10 Ω cm, in the electrical resistivity. Band structure and density of states calculations have been carried out on the basis of the density functional theory to account for the experimental results.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Gordillo%20Garcia-Nuria","name":"Nuria","surname":"Gordillo
