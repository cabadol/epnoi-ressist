With these results, a further analysis on the 238Pu and 56Fe cross sections has been performed, comparing the evaluations provided in the JEFF-3.1.2 and ENDF/B-VII.1 libraries for these nuclides. Then, the effect in MYRRHA of the differences between evaluations are analysed, presenting the source of the differences. With these results, recommendations for the 56Fe and 238Pu evaluations are suggested. These calculations have been performed with SCALE6.1 and MCNPX-2.7e.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Diez%20de%20la%20Obra-Carlos%20Javier","name":"Carlos Javier","surname":"Diez de la Obra"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Cabellos%20de%20Francisco-Oscar%20Luis","name":"Oscar Luis","surname":"Cabellos de Francisco"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Martinez-J.S.","name":"J.S.","surname":"Martinez"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Stankovskiy-Alexey","name":"Alexey","surname":"Stankovskiy"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Van%20den%20Eynde-Gert","name":"Gert","surname":"Van den Eynde"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Schillebeeckx-Peter","name":"Peter","surname":"Schillebeeckx"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Heyse-Jan","name":"Jan","surname":"Heyse"}]},"bagOfWords":[]}
