Calculations are performed with JEFF-3.1.1 and ENDF/B-VII.1, and these are compared with experimental values. An uncertainty propagation assessment of the current nuclear data uncertainties is performed.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Cabellos%20de%20Francisco-Oscar%20Luis","name":"Oscar Luis","surname":"Cabellos de Francisco"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Fusco-V.","name":"V.","surname":"Fusco"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Diez%20de%20la%20Obra-Carlos%20Javier","name":"Carlos Javier","surname":"Diez de la Obra"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Martinez-J.S.","name":"J.S.","surname":"Martinez"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Castro%20Gonz%C3%A1lez-Emilio","name":"Emilio","surname":"Castro González"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Cano-D.","name":"D.","surname":"Cano"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Gonz%C3%A1lez-E.","name":"E.","surname":"González"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/%C3%81lvarez%20Velarde-F.","name":"F.","surname":"Álvarez Velarde"}]},"bagOfWords":[]}
