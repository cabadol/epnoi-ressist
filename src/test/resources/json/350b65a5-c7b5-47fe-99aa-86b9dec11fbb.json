The packing of particles affects to the physical properties of the granular system. In particular, the crucial influence of particle size distribution (PSD) on the random packing structure increase the interest in relating both, either theoretically or by computational methods. A packing computational method is developed in order to estimate the void fraction corresponding to a fractal-like particle size distribution.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Garc%C3%ADa-Guti%C3%A9rrez%20Baez-Carlos","name":"Carlos","surname":"García-Gutiérrez Baez"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Martin%20Martin-Miguel%20Angel","name":"Miguel Angel","surname":"Martin Martin"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Mu%C3%B1oz%20Ortega-Francisco%20Javier","name":"Francisco Javier","surname":"Muñoz Ortega"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Reyes%20Castro-Miguel%20E.","name":"Miguel E.","surname":"Reyes Castro"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Taguas%20Coejo-Francisco%20Javier","name":"Francisco Javier","surname":"Taguas Coejo"}]},"bagOfWords":["particl","distribut","granular","comput","model","simul","poros","fractal","system","studi","method","interest","structur","differ","result","follow","algorithm","relat","fraction","media","influenc","final","compu","grain","materi","which","replic","sampl","madrid","great","properti","random","increas","between","paramet","measur","overlap","center","figur","standard","deviat","spain","correspond","address","martin","field","scienc","technolog","affect","physic","particular","either","theoret","order","volum","sphere","given","apollonian","radii","appli","propos","defin","initi","suppos","retain","transform","subinterv","elton","theorem","first","process","vector","calcul","contact","variat","function","implement","number","varianc","powder","technol","ergod","applic","pedofract","technic","univers","author","miguelangel","abstract","crucial","develop","estim","keyword","introduct","particul","observ","expect","produc","grind","jointli","effect","densiti","probabilist","approach","determin","dimension","investig","natur","lognorm","carlo","creat","spheric","version","practic","statist","similar","might","requir","after","amount","equival","inform","greater","think","linear","interv","respect","invari","verifi","easili","describ","accord","uniform","posit","within","squar","domain","equal","multipli","second","rearrang","repeat","reloc","perform","search","displac","equat","jijij","where","distanc","arithmet","account","anoth","nearest","neighbour","section","gener","shown","three","summar","exampl","diamet","continu","circl","coordin","length","conclus","depend","should","ensur","reliabl","obtain","repres","element","porou","medium","indic","further","aknnowledg","research","partial","nacion","investigacion","cientifica","desarrollo","innovacion","tecnologica","under","refer","solid","chapman","london","andreasen","andersen","moreland","roualt","assoulin","anishchik","medvedek","nolan","kavanagh","tagua","character","theori","dynam"]}
