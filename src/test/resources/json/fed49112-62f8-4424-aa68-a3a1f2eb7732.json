By means of linear optimization the sizes of the prestressing cables with a given fixed geometry are obtained. This simple procedure of linear optimization is also used to obtain the ‘best’ cable profile, by combining a series of feasible cable profiles. The results are compared with the ones obtained by other researchers. A step ahead in the field of optimization of prestressed bridge decks is the simultaneous search of the geometry and size of the prestressing cables. A non-linear programming for optimization is used, namely, ‘the steepest gradient method’. The results obtained are compared with the ones computed previously by means of linear programming techniques. Finally, the general problem of structural optimization is considered. This problem consists in finding the sizes and geometries of the prestressing cables as well as the longitudinal variation of the concrete section.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Samart%C3%ADn-Avelino","name":"Avelino","surname":"Samartín"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Utrilla%20Arroyo-M.A.","name":"M.A.","surname":"Utrilla Arroyo"}]},"bagOfWords":["prestress","optim","section","design","bridg","famili","exampl","obtain","stress","geometri","longitudin","result","comput","concret","given","profil","problem","follow","linear","procedur","consid","method","program","structur","analysi","differ","servic","state","combin","final","order","correspond","research","solut","ultim","transvers","unknown","three","configur","feasibl","repres","initi","defin","condit","assum","moment","function","paper","present","techniqu","variat","construct","usual","carri","check","respect","automat","continu","describ","definit","known","displac","found","along","bottom","appli","object","variabl","where","compar","gener","optimum","simplif","develop","applic","first","reinforc","properti","length","model","treat","error","should","passiv","allow","cross","ordin","compress","number","produc","sever","includ","approach","approxim","studi","refer","madrid","samartin","simpl","other","gradient","previous","import","previou","avail","minimum","effici","special","simpli","support","portal","frame","howev","report","insid","relat","expert","system","summar","whole","distribut","analys","accord","plate","singl","coeffici","specifi","amount","determin","shear","torsion","weight","normal","tension","minim","selfweight","maximum","posit","simplex","chang","illustr","capabl","shown","slope","deriv","modifi","admiss","simplifi","everi","specif","alreadi","effort","templeman","cellular","numer","realist","maquoi","randal","kirsch","metodo","puent","estructura","quiroga","utrilla","arroyo","summari","ahead","field","simultan","search","steepest","consist","introduct","frequent","intersect","traffic","occur","durabl","mainten","aesthet","advantag","arrang","heurist","engin","experi","valid","interest","intervent","handl","introduc","drastic","class","confin","academ","standpoint","without","extend","practic","progress","author","larger","project","subsequ","magnitud","dation","steel","local","level","precast","place","cantilev","stage","appropri","beamlik","chain","element","total","multigird","orthotrop","detail","literatur","group","trial","limit","safeti","greater","discuss","ascertain","uniform","abnorm","those","axial","inertia","minof","subject","momenr","depend","under","consider","nation","eight","posjtjon","nummum","sectionj","exist","which","inappropri","particular","descnbcd","forcf","actual","bndge","reduc","locat","current","opttmal","accordingli","partial","common","notat","increment","therefor","vector","start","subfamili","assess","second","equal","extern","ident","composit","instanc","compos","straight","segment","between","basic","observ","close","further","direct","excel","winter","complet","difficulti","troubl","strong","conclus","although","deserv","moreov","extens","foreseen","dimensionn","precoinstraint","hyperstatiqu","belgium","layout","indetermin","roumain","scienc","engng","struct","gonzalez","dimensionamiento","directo","pretensado","hiperstatico","doctor","etsiccp","univers","calculo","hormigon","rueda","hernandez","disei","colegio","winterbottom","spine","lnstn"]}
