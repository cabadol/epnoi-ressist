In this paper, an improved minimum time control approach for multiphase buck converter that is based on charge balance technique, aiming at fast output voltage transition is presented. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed control takes into account the phase delay and current ripple in each phase. Therefore, by investigating the behavior of multiphase converter during voltage transition, it resolves the problem of current unbalance after the transient, which can lead to long settling time of the output voltage. The restriction of this control is that the output voltage that the converter can provide is related to the number of the phases, because only the duty cycles at which the multiphase converter has total ripple cancellation are used in this approach. The model of the proposed control is introduced, and the design constraints of the buck converters filter for this control are discussed. In order to prove the concept, a four-phase buck converter is implemented and the experimental results that validate the proposed control method are presented. The application of this control to RF envelope tracking is also presented in this paper.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Cheng-Pengming","name":"Pengming","surname":"Cheng"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Garc%C3%ADa%20Su%C3%A1rez-Oscar","name":"Oscar","surname":"García
