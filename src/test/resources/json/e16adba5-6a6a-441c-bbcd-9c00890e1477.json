Therefore the development of efficient visual-processing software to be equipped in effective artificial agents is a must.\nIn this project we study and develop a visual-processing software that will work as the “eyes” of a cognitive robot. This software performs a three-dimensional mapping of the robot’s environment, providing it with the essential information required to make proper decisions during its navigation. Due to the complexity of this objective we have adopted the Scrum methodology in order to achieve an agile development process, which has allowed us to correct and improve in a fast way the successive versions of the product.\nThe present project is structured in Sprints, which cover the different stages of the software development based on the requirements imposed by the robot and its real necessities.\nWe have initially explored different commercial devices oriented to the acquisition of the required visual information, adopting the Kinect Sensor camera (Microsoft) as the most suitable option. Later on, we have studied the available software to manage the obtained visual information as well as its integration with the robot’s software, choosing the high-level platform Matlab as the common nexus to join the management of the camera, the management of the robot and the implementation of the behavioral algorithms.\nDuring the last stages the software has been developed to include the fundamental functionalities required to process the real environment, such as depth representation, segmentation, and clustering.\nFinally the software has been optimized to exhibit real-time processing and a suitable performance to fulfill the robot’s requirements during its operation in real situations.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/L%C3%A1zaro%20N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez-%C3%81lvaro","name":"Álvaro","surname":"Lázaro
