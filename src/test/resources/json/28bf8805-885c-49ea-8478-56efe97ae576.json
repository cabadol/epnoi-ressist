The processed library in ACE format at ten different temperatures was generated with NJOY-99.364 nuclear data processing system. In addition, NJOY-99 inputs are provided to generate PENDF, GENDF, MATXSR and BOXER formats. The library has undergone strict QA procedures, being compared with other available libraries (e.g. ENDF/B-VII.1) and processing codes as PREPRO-2000 codes. A set of 119 criticality benchmark experiments taken from ICSBEP-2010 has been used for validation purposes.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Cabellos%20de%20Francisco-Oscar%20Luis","name":"Oscar Luis","surname":"Cabellos de Francisco"}]},"bagOfWords":[]}
