Previous versions of the GRS XSUSA library propagated only neutron cross section uncertainties. We have extended XSUSA uncertainty assessment capabilities by including propagation of fission yields and decay data uncertainties due to the their relevance in depletion simulations. We apply this extended methodology to the UAM6 PWR Pin-Cell Burnup Benchmark, which involves uncertainty propagation through burnup.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Mart%C3%ADnez-J.S.","name":"J.S.","surname":"Mart√≠nez"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Zwermann-W.","name":"W.","surname":"Zwermann"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Gallner-L.","name":"L.","surname":"Gallner"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Puente%20Espel-F.","name":"F.","surname":"Puente Espel"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Cabellos%20de%20Francisco-Oscar%20Luis","name":"Oscar Luis","surname":"Cabellos de Francisco"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Velkov-K.","name":"K.","surname":"Velkov"},{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Hannstein-V.","name":"V.","surname":"Hannstein"}]},"bagOfWords":[]}
