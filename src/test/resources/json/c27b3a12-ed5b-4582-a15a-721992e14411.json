Soil, sediments, powders, granular materials, colloidal and particulate\nsuspensions are examples of systems involving many size particles. For those systems, the statistical description of the particle size distribution (PSD), that is, the\nmathematical distribution that defines the relative amounts of particles present, sorted according to size, is a crutial issue. The PSD can be important in understanding soil hydraulic properties, the geological origin or\nsediments or the physical and chemical properties of granular materials and ceramics, among others.","creators":[{"uri":"http://resources.ressist.es/author/Martin%20Martin-Miguel%20Angel","name":"Miguel Angel","surname":"Martin Martin"}]},"bagOfWords":["distribut","model","particl","granular","system","media","materi","studi","properti","particul","propos","natur","fractal","random","paramet","sediment","origin","ceram","depend","number","sphere","approach","complex","madrid","address","interest","scienc","technolog","suspens","involv","those","statist","mathemat","crutial","hydraul","physic","other","sever","grind","point","differ","structur","porou","densiti","intergranular","space","predict","simpl","comput","lognorm","given","simul","andreasen","andersen","commonli","inform","theori","thermodynam","miguel","angel","martina","departamento","matematica","aplicada","escuela","tecnica","superior","ingeniero","agronomo","technicaluniversityof","spain","phone","miguelangel","martin","great","field","powder","colloid","exampl","descript","defin","amount","present","accord","import","understand","geolog","chemic","among","probabl","weibul","tradition","gener","crush","bagnold","occur","laplac","fieller","altern","scenario","mandelbrot","turcott","connect","between","fragment","start","particularli","instanc","pachepski","sornett","affect","highli","water","retent","geometr","scale","arrang","disregard","occupi","engeni","concentr","amorph","alloi","microstructur","liquid","becaus","attract","research","particular","influenc","increas","relat","either","theoret","method","moreland","effect","gaussian","roualt","assoul","probabilist","determin","volumen","anishchik","medvedev","apollonian","investig","nolan","kavanag","carlo","spheric","togeth","produc","below","certain","physicoempir","formul","fraction","obtain","industri","author","beyond","classic","provid","simultan","scarc","grain","interpret","under","featur","observ","essenti","primari","principl","achiev","allow","introduc","meaning","entropi","candid","drive","context","spirit","aspect","pioneer","matter","persu","similar","object","appli","concept","mechan"]}
